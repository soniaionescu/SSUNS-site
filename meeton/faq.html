                <div class="cd-faq-content">
                    <p>As one of your first steps, we highly recommend that you check out your committee’s background guide on our committee page that your Daises have put much effort into composing. The background guide will have outlined and explained a number of topics that you will be debating at the conference. It is helpful to know your committee’s history, current events, and other subject matter that you think will be relevant during debate. Keep in mind that it is your responsibility to thoroughly research your character or country, such as their position in terms of the topics, their allies, policies, etc. A thoroughly researched delegate is often the well-spoken delegate, as it will reflect in your speeches and interactions with your fellow delegates.

                        Your position paper is due November 10th, 2016. Please look at position paper guidelines below for more information.

                <div class="cd-faq-content">
                    <p>If you wish to clarify something about your characters, committee or information on the background guide, please contact your Chair at the respective committee’s email address. You can find the individual committee emails on our committee page, by clicking on the appropriate committee. Also don’t forget to consult the committee background guide first if you have questions about research. Most Daises have already listed Questions to Consider and Helpful Research Links as part of their background guides. </p>

                <div class="cd-faq-content">
                    <p>SSUNS this year offers a variety of stimulating and exclusive events such as a tour of the ICAO Head Quarters, which is a Specialized Agency of the United Nations. A group of applicants will be randomly selected to go on this tour, for which you can sign up closer to the conference. Stay posted to our social media announcements!

                        We have also included a Model UN Training Workshop and a Youth Leadership Summit on Thursday; McGill Tour, SSUNS Walkway and McGill Q&A on Friday; and the Delegate Gala on Saturday. More information on the individual events can be found in your delegate handbook. </p>

                    <p>All participants at SSUNS are required to wear full western business attire. We urge you to adhere to the dress code for all SSUNS events, such as the Opening/Closing ceremonies, committee sessions, public events, excluding the delegate social event and unless otherwise directed by your Dais.

                        For the Delegate Gala, please use your discretion in dressing casually but appropriately. SSUNS staff reserves the right to remove delegates dressed inappropriately or offensively for the delegate social event.

                <div class="cd-faq-content">
                    <p>Yes! Although it’s not mandatory, it is recommended that you bring your own computer to research, draft working papers, etc. outside of your committee sessions. Usage of laptops or portable electronic devices during sessions is subject to the individual discretion of Daises and it may be prohibited during selective or all committee sessions.

                        There will be also computers available for conference-related uses such as research in our Delegate Resource Centre.

                    <p>All SSUNS delegates are required to submit a position paper prior to the conference (with the exception of selective Crisis committee delegates). There is a section in your background guide for Questions to Consider and/or Helpful Links that will help you get your research started. Also don’t forget to check out our Delegate Resources page for more tips!
                        It is a research essay detailing your country or character’s position in your committee, specifically on the topics outlined in the background guide. We urge you to avoid reiterating information already elaborated in the background guide, except for when explaining their significance to your specific character or pointing out something you wish to underscore during the committee debate. Having a well-written position paper will help you organize your research, become familiarized with your character, and enhance your delegate experience throughout the conference.</p>

                    <p>It is due at 11:59PM on November 10th, 2016. It is always a good idea to submit it in advance. Feel free to email your Daises any questions regarding your position paper, but allow sufficient time before the deadline to ensure you receive feedback!</p>

                    <p>While we do not provide specific format guidelines for individual position papers, every position paper should be written in coherence to a formal academic paper you would normally submit at your school. We urge you to use your discretion in determining the appropriate format of the paper. On another note, SSUNS has a very strict plagiarism policy. You must take care to acknowledge any ideas or information obtained from the work of others in your paper. You may check out our Delegate Resources page for more information on how to cite.

                        Please refer to McGill University’s Code of Student Conduct and Disciplinary Procedures on Plagiarism for further clarification:

                        Article 16. Plagiarism
                        “Plagiarism” means the representation of another’s work, published or unpublished, as one’s own or assisting another in representing another’s work, published or unpublished, as his or her own.

                        (a) No student shall represent another person’s work, published or unpublished, as his or her own in any academic writing […], or represent as his or her own the work of another, whether the material so represented constitutes a part or the entirety of the work submitted.

Hence each year, SSUNS wishes to acknowledge exceptional delegates and delegations who enrich the educational experience for their peer delegates and embody our theme of advocacy, peacemaking and diplomacy. We have two categories of awards as further described below: Individual Awards and Delegation Awards. All Individual Gavel Awards are given equal weight and they are not ranked in order. </p>
