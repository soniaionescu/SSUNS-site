                                <div class="desc"><p>Presenting our very own Secretary-General of SSUNS 2017, Dexter Docherty, a Vancouverite who is finishing off his Honours History degree with a double minor in Philosophy and Economics. Dexter has previously served as USG Committees in 2016 and Deputy Director of Crisis Committees in 2015, and is incredibly excited to celebrate SSUNS’ 25th anniversary this year with the 1400+ delegates who attend the conference each year! When Dexter is not pulling pranks on other members of the Secretariat (beware!) or going on long philosophical walks with his friends, he enjoys studying modern history because it helps understand the world we live in. Dexter’s favourite 90s memory is receiving a giant box of several thousand legos when he was 4 (note: he is very curious), which is undoubtedly the best gift he has ever received (until the Secretariat surprises him for his 23rd birthday)! If you spot Dexter during the conference, he will either be sleeping after a long night at the Delegate Gala, or working on his goal of becoming really good at crossword-solving before he dies.</p></div>

Khaleesi is a close second.</p></div>

Garima hopes to live in Latin America and work for the OAS or UN once she completes her degree in History, Political Science, and Feminist studies. As a delegate herself, SSUNS has been a meaningful and empowering experience for Garima, providing her with a platform to speak out about contentious issues and express herself unapologetically. As a highly intellectual person, Garima loves speaking about politics and female empowerment in one of the many languages she is fluent in; in fact, she even had the chance to address the Canadian parliament. During her free time, you can find her reading, writing about politics, watching Gilmore Girls, and enjoying the sun in Parc Jean Drapeau when the weather permits. Garima sends her love to all the delegates and strongly encourages you all to break out of your comfort zones! Whether this is your first conference or one of your last, don’t be afraid to set ambitious goals for yourself and your committee. Learn as much as you can from the diversity around you, as well as the wide range of perspectives that SSUNS brings together. .</p></div>

Home is where the heart is, so one shouldn’t be surprised that Gordon is an avid Ottawa Senators fan, but his passions lie beyond just hockey. He is also an Eagle Scout with Gold Palm Honours and has worked a multitude of jobs, from delivering flowers to math tutoring to waiting tables and fixing cars. Thinking of planning a road trip? Gordon’s got you covered; he travelled across the United States last summer in a car he built himself. One day, he would love to be the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund. Gordon is extremely pumped to see everyone at SSUNS this year, but whatever you do, don’t go around calling him “Ops”…</p></div>

In fact, she’s acted as both a committee director and crisis staffer at previous SSUNS conferences! Born and raised in Dubai, Khyati enjoys playing tennis, reading mystery novels, and writing short stories in her spare time. In a perfect world, she dreams of travelling to Mykonos and opening her very own ballet school. When the Montreal weather permits (read: rarely), you can find her running up Mont Royal to watch the sunset. Khyati’s favourite part of SSUNS is meeting so many different people and learning from each and every one. She hopes you’re just as excited for SSUNS 2017 as she is! </p></div>

She hails from the bustling metropolis that is the financial capital of our beloved land, Toronto! Meghan has been involved with Model UN for 8 years now, and has passionately been contributing her hard work and relentless love to the SSUNS Secretariat for 3 years to date. When she’s not brainstorming potential committee ideas, she can be found leading canoe trips through Northern Ontario in the summertime, or engaging in the many intramural sports that McGill offers: V-ball, ultimate frisbee, soccer, and ball hockey! A word of advice, be wary of asking Meghan where she would travel if given the opportunity: New Zealand the Amazon rainforest are but a few of the thousands of destinations on her list. SSUNS has consistently given her the privilege of being inspired, working with incredible people, and interfacing with delegates from all corners of the globe, who will one day be tomorrow’s leaders. She also loves hugs!  </p></div>

Her favourite part of SSUNS is seeing all of the delegates in action, as they make the most of this incredible learning opportunity. Your Deputy Chargée d’Affairs grew up in the Netherlands, but today she calls Oakville, Ontario her home. When she is not occupied with MUN-related activities or going back to Toronto, Hena plays competitive soccer (she even represented Canada in international competitions!) and scouts for new cafés in downtown Montreal. In a couple of years, you can find Hena owning her own corporate law firm with a golden retriever named Laika by her side.</p></div>

Nicole is an ambitious and incredibly sharp young woman who hopes to someday work as a humanitarian lawyer at the International Criminal Court.

Ashton’s other life goals include learning to tie his shoelaces, growing up to be a diplomat and living by the philosophy, “it’s not where you go, it’s who you go with.” While he wishes he could live out either Iron Man, James Bond or 21 Jump Street, he believes that his TV show character alter ego is Tyrion Lannister. According to Ashton himself, he’d be the first to die in a horror movie -- he’s too small to survive to the end! He’s very excited for SSUNS 2017!</p></div>

                                    <h5>Dany Morcos</h5>

                                <div class="desc"><p>Dany studies Industrial and Labour relations at McGill. He was born and raised in Abu Dhabi, but is originally from Egypt. He now splits his time between Montreal and Waterloo, Ontario. He started MUN in grade 12, and staffed McMUN this past year. Dany helps budget and allocate Student’s funds towards space planning projects on campus. He also secretly plays the piano. More importantly, Dany loves to cook and claims to make the best tiramisu ever. When he’s not talking about Suits or mimicking Gordon Ramsay in the kitchen, Dany enjoys drinking mojitos on the beach and arguing because he finds solace in heated discussions. If he could travel anywhere in the world, Dany would go to Bora Bora. In the future, this bright McGill student sees himself working in the Canadian Labour Movement. Dany’s favourite thing about SSUNS is his beloved Secretariat. Sometimes he loves them more than they love him. Just kidding! We love you, Dany.</p></div>
